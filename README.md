# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# How to run the program locally

## Make sure docker is installed
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## Request for the firebase auth key
You can reach out on the issue of this page.

## Run the docker-compose.yaml
run `docker compose up --detach --build`

## Wait untill the process is done
You will see a new container in your docker and wait untill all images is running.

## Open your browser
Access http://localhost:3000 for User 1 and Http://localhost:3006 for User 2.

# Deployment
Need to deploy manually.

# Running the Assignment 5
## Pre-requisites:
1. Make sure that you have all the necessary import/dependencies in your project.
2. Make sure that your are at the directory ay2324s1-course-assessment-g12.

## Steps
1. Make sure that you have started the RabbitMQ Server with all the necessary configs.
2. Run `npm run test-matching` in the terminal. You will be redirected to your browser where 2 tabs will open.
3. Sign up or Log in on 2 different account as you can't access the services unless you have one. You can also use the user:
4. You should be in the Home page with Looking like the following picture. Else, please press Home and the navigation bar on top.
5. Enter the parameters that you want to be matched on. You need to pick 2 things, 1 for difficulty and 1 for programming language.
6. Once you have picked the necessary choices, press match and you will see a loading animation with a timer countdown from 30 s.
7. At the other tab, do the same thing as you did in the first tab. Make sure, that you have chosen  the same parameter within 30 s, else you will need to redo the whole step.
8. Once matched, both tabs will be redirected to the collaboration page and we're done

## Unsuccessfull matching
1. We set a timer of 30s for matching, if within that time frame there's no match, the animation icon will be disappear.
